Boris Bikes
==========

Makers Academy week 2
----------

An introduction to object-oriented programming and TDD, simulating London's Boris Bikes hire system.

Instructions
---------

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/spike01/boris_bikes.git
```

Feel free to use your preferred REPL. I personally use [Pry](http://pryrepl.org/). Also, running the tests to get an idea of what this simulation can and can't do is advised.

```shell
$ rspec
$ pry
$ require './boris_bikes'
```

boris_bikes.rb loads all the lib files, so you don't have to do it manually each time. Then create instances of each class, and play around with them like so much digital Lego.
